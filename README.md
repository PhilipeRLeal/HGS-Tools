# HGS Tools
A collections of Python tools and shell scripts to set up and run hydrologic simulations with the HydroGeoSphere model (HGS). Tools to manage the model output and import the data into GeoPy are also included.


HydroGeoSphere is an integrated surface-subsurface hydrologic model developed by [Aquanty Inc.](http://www.aquanty.com/hydrogeosphere/)
